## Contents
- Lab 1 - **Fisher Model**
> A mathematical model describing how a biological population spreads over time and space. It combines logistic population growth with diffusion, representing both natural population increase and spatial dispersal.
- Lab 2 - **Immunofluorescence Data Analysis**
> Analysis of immunofluorescence microscopy cell images using various machine learning and graph-based methods
- Lab 2 - **Mass Spectrometry Data Analysis**
> Classification model for the offset function, which determines the rounded integer difference between the mass of the most abundant peak and the monoisotopic mass obtained from mass spectroscopy experiments
