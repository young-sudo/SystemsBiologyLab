## Introduction

Immunofluorescence (IF) Data Analysis

Immunofluorescence is a microscopy-based technique that uses fluorescently-labeled antibodies to visualize the presence and localization of specific antigens within cells or tissues. It relies on the emission of light at specific wavelengths by fluorophores conjugated to antibodies, allowing for visual observation of antigen distribution under a fluorescence microscope.

**DAPI** - a marker for detecting cell nuclei

DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) is a fluorescent dye commonly used in microscopy to stain DNA and help locate cell structures. DAPI is known for its ability to bind specifically to the DNA double helix, emitting blue fluorescence when excited with ultraviolet (UV) light.

Our Data:

| Marker Panel | IF1 | IF2 | IF3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Markers | CD11c, CD20, CD163, CD3, CD15 | **PD1**, **PDL1**, CD8, Ki67, GB | CD8, CD4, **FOXP3**, CK, CD56, CD3 |

**Project Goals**:

- Characterize the distribution of protein biomarker signals on different IF slides.
- Characterize the local environments of cancer cells (at the cellular level, but also within regions of interest (ROI)).
- Identify differences within IF slides in the context of enrichment in immune cells.
- Identify significant co-occurrences of different protein biomarkers.
- Search for areas that are candidates for TLS (Tertiary lymphoid structures).
